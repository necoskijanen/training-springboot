## Current System State

### Implemented Features
1. **Login/Logout System**
   - Spring Security configured
   - BCrypt password encoding
   - Custom authentication success handler for role-based redirects

2. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Two roles: ADMIN and USER
   - URL-based authorization rules
   - Separate home pages for each role

3. **Database Schema**
   - User management (user_master table)
   - Role definitions (role_definition table)
   - User-role relationships (user_role table)
   - Support for many-to-many user-role associations

4. **User Interface**
   - Login page (Thymeleaf template)
   - Admin home page
   - User home page

### Not Yet Implemented
1. **Logging System**
   - No structured logging in place
   - Need to implement JSON logging
   - Need to add proper log levels and context

2. **Batch Execution Interface**
   - No batch controller yet
   - No batch service layer
   - No process management

3. **Batch Status Monitoring**
   - No REST API for status polling
   - No real-time status updates
   - No status tracking mechanism

4. **Batch Execution History**
   - No history database schema
   - No history display page
   - No pagination

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
Based on the specifications, the next features to implement are:

1. **Logging Implementation**
   - Add Logback configuration
   - Implement structured JSON logging
   - Add logging to existing components
   - Create security event logging

2. **Batch Processing Foundation**
   - Create batch execution domain models
   - Design batch history database schema
   - Implement batch service layer
   - Create batch controller

3. **Batch Status API**
   - Design REST API endpoints
   - Implement asynchronous execution
   - Create status tracking mechanism
   - Build status polling endpoint

4. **Batch Execution UI**
   - Create batch execution page
   - Implement program selection interface
   - Add status display with auto-refresh
   - Build execution history view

5. **Pagination**
   - Add pagination support to MyBatis queries
   - Implement page navigation UI
   - Add page size configuration

### Open Questions
- Which directory should be configured for batch programs?
- What format should batch programs be in? (shell scripts, JAR files, etc.)
- Should batch execution be restricted to ADMIN role only?
- What should the default page size be for history pagination?
- Should there be a maximum execution time for batch processes?

### Technical Decisions Needed
- Logging format: Determine exact JSON schema for logs
- Batch execution: Decide on thread pool size and configuration
- Database: Plan migration strategy from H2 to production database
- Error handling: Define error response format for REST API

## Development Guidelines Reminder

### Code Standards
- All code comments in English
- Follow DDD, TDD, FP principles
- Separation of concerns, high cohesion, loose coupling
- Domain logic independent of frameworks

### Security Practices
- Validate all user input
- Never log personal information
- Escape data before sending to other systems
- Apply defense in depth

### Git Workflow
- Commit messages in English: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
- Create feature branches: `feature/<issue>-<description>`
- One logical change per commit
- Use pull requests for code review

### Testing Approach
- Write tests first (TDD)
- Test as specifications
- Small increments
- Continuous refactoring

## Context for Next Session

When resuming work on this project:

1. **Review Memory Bank**: Read all core memory bank files to understand current state
2. **Check Open Questions**: Address any unresolved technical decisions
3. **Follow Next Steps**: Implement features in priority order
4. **Update Documentation**: Keep memory bank files current with changes
5. **Maintain Standards**: Adhere to coding and security guidelines

### Key Files to Review
- `docs/specifications.md` - Original requirements
- `docs/rules/*.md` - Coding standards and practices
- `memory-bank/*.md` - Current project state and context

### Current Technology Context
- Java 21 with Spring Boot 3.5.6
- MyBatis for data access
- H2 in-memory database
- Spring Security for authentication/authorization
- Thymeleaf for server-side rendering
