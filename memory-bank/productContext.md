# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Domain
Defense industry and enterprise systems require robust, secure applications for managing user access and batch processing operations. This training project serves as a reference implementation demonstrating:

1. **Enterprise Security Requirements**
   - Role-based access control is critical in defense systems
   - Different user types need different levels of access
   - Audit trails and logging are mandatory for security compliance

2. **Batch Processing Needs**
   - Many defense systems need to execute background processes
   - Monitoring and tracking batch operations is essential
   - Asynchronous execution prevents UI blocking
   - Historical data helps with troubleshooting and compliance

3. **Training Objectives**
   - Provide hands-on experience with enterprise Java technologies
   - Demonstrate security best practices in the defense sector
   - Show proper implementation of common enterprise patterns

## Problems Being Solved

### Security & Access Control
- **Problem**: Unauthorized access to sensitive functionality
- **Solution**: Spring Security with role-based authorization
- **Benefit**: Only authorized users can access appropriate features

### User Experience
- **Problem**: Generic interfaces don't serve different user types well
- **Solution**: Role-specific home screens and navigation
- **Benefit**: Users see only relevant functionality for their role

### Batch Operations Management
- **Problem**: No visibility into background process execution
- **Solution**: Real-time status monitoring via REST API polling
- **Benefit**: Users can track progress without manual intervention

### Historical Data Access
- **Problem**: Difficulty tracking past batch executions
- **Solution**: Execution history with pagination
- **Benefit**: Easy access to audit trails and troubleshooting data

### System Monitoring
- **Problem**: Lack of visibility into system operations and errors
- **Solution**: Comprehensive structured logging
- **Benefit**: Easier debugging, monitoring, and compliance reporting

## How It Should Work

### User Journey - Admin User

1. **Login**
   - Admin navigates to login page
   - Enters credentials
   - System authenticates and identifies admin role

2. **Admin Home**
   - Redirected to admin-specific home screen
   - Access to all administrative functions
   - Can manage batch operations

3. **Batch Execution**
   - Select batch program from configured directory
   - Click execute
   - System runs program asynchronously
   - Status updates every 5 seconds via REST API
   - View execution results

4. **View History**
   - Access execution history
   - Navigate through paginated results
   - Review past execution outcomes

### User Journey - Regular User

1. **Login**
   - User navigates to login page
   - Enters credentials
   - System authenticates and identifies user role

2. **User Home**
   - Redirected to user-specific home screen
   - Limited functionality based on role
   - Can view batch history but may have restricted execution rights

### Technical Workflow - Batch Execution

1. **Initialization**
   - System reads configured batch directory on startup
   - Validates available programs

2. **Execution Request**
   - User selects program and initiates execution
   - System spawns asynchronous process
   - Returns immediately with tracking ID

3. **Status Monitoring**
   - Frontend polls REST API every 5 seconds
   - Backend checks process status
   - Returns one of:
     - "Running" - still executing
     - "Completed Successfully" - exit code 0
     - "Failed [exit_code]" - non-zero exit code

4. **History Recording**
   - Upon completion, result is saved to database
   - Includes: program name, start time, end time, status, exit code
   - Available in paginated history view

## User Experience Goals

### Simplicity
- Clean, intuitive interface
- Minimal clicks to perform common tasks
- Clear status indicators

### Security
- No unauthorized access to restricted features
- Clear indication of current user and role
- Secure logout functionality

### Reliability
- Batch processes don't hang the UI
- Clear error messages when things go wrong
- Consistent behavior across all functions

### Visibility
- Users always know what the system is doing
- Clear feedback for all actions
- Easy access to historical data
