# Secure Coding Principles

- Validate all user input to prevent malicious data from affecting the system.
- Review and fix any warnings displayed during code compilation.
- Write code in compliance with the organization's security policies.
- Keep system design simple and easy to understand.
- Deny access by default and explicitly grant permissions only when necessary.
- Grant only the minimum necessary privileges to programs and users.
- Escape data before sending it to other systems.
- Implement multiple layers of defense instead of relying on a single security measure.
- Apply quality assurance techniques such as code reviews and testing to ensure code security and reliability.
- Follow industry-standard secure coding guidelines and best practices.
- Ensure secure default configurations so that security is maintained without requiring manual intervention.
- Eliminate unnecessary system or application features to reduce potential attack vectors.
